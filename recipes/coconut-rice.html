    <h2>How to make Coconut rice</h2>
    <p>It’s not an exaggeration to say that rice is eaten at least two to three times a week in an average Nigerian home. We make rice recipes like jollof rice, fried rice, rice and beans, native jollof rice, and many more rice recipes. we eat rice for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, sometimes for snacks. Coconut rice is a staple in most Nigerian homes. However, the way we make it differ from home to home. I have adapted my moms’ delicious recipe and as usual, I added my own spin by using the chicken thighs instead of a whole chicken. The broth from the dark meat of the chicken adds more flavor to the coconut rice. (You can remove the skin on the thighs to economize on the fat).</p>
